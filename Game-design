(?) Uncertain

Game:
    800x800 window (?)
    32x32 sprites

    288 pixels are outisde the game board (144 on each sides):
        Can be used for UI?

Gameplay:
    2 players:
        Each controls it own character
        Mouvements with keyboard

    Map:
        2d tile based map (16x16 with outside borders)

        Some specials tiles:
            player inverters
            teleporters
            switch
            pressure plate
            doors

    Goal:
        Characters starts on they starting tile
        They need to go to their own ending tile (or the same?)

Network:
    Things needed to be synced:
        Player position: every time a player moves, send his new position

        Switch status  |
                       |> Thoses can be handle by the local player
        Doors status   |

        player inverters status
        next map loading

Map:
    No map is hardcoded in the game, all maps are load from files
    Json files:
        16x16 array with every tile and its default status

    Map creator:
        Separate application:
            Save map as json file

    The server tells the player which map he needs to load:
        How to know if the player has the right map:
            Hash the json file with the same name as the one given by the server:
                If the hash given by the server and the player's map hash is the same:
                    Right map
                Else:
                    Wrong map
